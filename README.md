# Setup
Clone this repository recursively:
`git clone --recursive https://github.gatech.edu/omscs66601/assignment_1.git`

(If your version of git does not support recurse clone, then clone without the option and tun `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`).

# Play against a test agent
To play against a test agent, use `python submit.py play_isolation`. (If you are a TA, add the option `--provider udacity`).

# Submit your code
To submit your code to have it evaluated for a grade, use `python submit.py play_isolation`.  You may submit as many times as you like.  The last submission before the deadline will be used to determine your grade.
